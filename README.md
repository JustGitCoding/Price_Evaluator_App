# The “When to Buy” App
## Description 
Train a Machine Learning Model to be able to recognize whether a product’s pricing is discounted based on the date, merchant info and product id.
## Reason Selected
There’s always a lot of ‘head knowledge’ of the best times to buy a certain item (ie always Black Friday) or from where to buy it (according to my dad Best Buy is always the best) but there’s a lack of actual hard evidence for this. We wanted to get rid of the prophesizing and create a model to predict whether you’re getting a good deal on something, or whether you should wait a couple more weeks for a sale.
## Questions we Hope to Answer:
- If I buy ‘item X’ today, am I getting a good deal on it?
- What are the pricing trends for item X? Per retailer?
- What retailer should I buy item X from?
- Is one retailer generally better than the others?
- Are the best deals always on holidays?

## Communication Methods
- We will meet every Tuesday/Thursday starting at 6:00 to review changes and to go over large problems.
- Team members will update each other daily on Slack
- If assistance is needed, impropmtu meetings will be scheduled using Slack. If not all members can be present in these meetings that is acceptable.
- All team members have each others email and phone number for contact purposes as well in case of issues
- Individual member updates will be stored in their corresponding Git branch (named for each member). Review by two memebers is needed to push an update to main.
